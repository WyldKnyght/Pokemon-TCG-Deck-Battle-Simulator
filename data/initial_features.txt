Use free or open-source resources to create a machine learning model AI.
Research any previous open source or free Pokemon TCG apps and or codes that may help with the development of this project.
Collect data on Pokemon TCG cards and sets from various sources, including online TCG forums, tournaments, and user-generated content.
Create a database of Pokemon TCG Theme Decks, V Battle Decks, League Battle Decks.
Clean and preprocess the collected data to remove any inconsistencies or outliers.
Choose an appropriate machine learning model that can simulate battles and predict outcomes.
Train the machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
Evaluate the trained model's performance by testing it on new data and comparing its predictions with the actual outcomes.
Develop a user-friendly application GUI Interface for importing deck.
Allow the player to import via copy and paste using the Pokemon TCG Online Export format.
Allow the player to choose to import the opponent's deck or have the model select a random premade deck.
Simulate 1000 battles or more if additional analysis is required.
Analyze the play and results and suggest ways to upgrade the decks to be more efficient and effective.
Suggest strategies to increase the odds of winning the game.
Ensure proper documentation throughout the project.
